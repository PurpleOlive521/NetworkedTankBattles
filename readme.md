###### Networked Tank Battles
A fully networked game developed in C++ using Raylib. The game features a custom virtual connection protocol using UDP with an authoritative server solution. Utilises a object-oriented approach with the a separate application-, network- and game-level.

###### Collaborators
This project was made in collaboration with Meike Lenting, who contributed with some of the networking code on the client side. Due to us working on the same code and files throughout the project, I am not able to isolate her contributions and credit it separately. Her work is entirely contained within the 'meteor-client' project. 

All the graphical assets used for the project was made by Meike Lenting.
